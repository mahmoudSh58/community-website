In SQL, the following data types are considered strings:

CHAR

VARCHAR

TEXT

BINARY

VARBINARY

BLOB

CHAR and VARCHAR are used to store character strings with a fixed or variable length, respectively. CHAR fields always have a fixed length, while VARCHAR fields can have a variable length up to a maximum length specified during table creation.

TEXT, BLOB, VARBINARY, and BINARY are used to store large amounts of text or binary data, such as documents, images, or audio files. TEXT and BLOB are used for character and binary data, respectively, and can store very large amounts of data.

NVARCHAR, NCHAR and NTEXT are also used to store strings in SQL, but these data types are specific to Microsoft SQL Server and are used for Unicode character data.

Note that different database systems may have slightly different data types for storing strings.
